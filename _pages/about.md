I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in the Department of Information and Communications Engineering at Tokyo Institute of Technology. I obtained my Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of California, San Diego, and my Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Wuhan University. My current research primarily focuses on Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations for interactive scenes, as well as haptic rendering and feedback in XR environments.
